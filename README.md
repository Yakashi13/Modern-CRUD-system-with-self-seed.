# ⚡ Modern CRUD System (HTML + CSS + JS)

A lightweight **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system** built purely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no databases, no backend!  

This project comes with a **self-seeding mechanism** 🪴 that auto-feeds initial demo data, so you can instantly play around with it. The data is stored **in-memory**, meaning everything resets automatically whenever you refresh the page. Perfect for learning, experimenting, or just geeking out with some JS logic!
